Welcome in my world ! â˜º

I am a self-made frontend developer. I've been learning programming for about six months. So far I have learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am a huge passionate about new technologies, especially blockchain, web 3.0 and space technologies. I'm not afraid to work hard and taking on new challenges. In my work I always focus on optimizing processes, writing clean code, aesthetics and organization.

I'm taking my first steps in the world of programming and can't wait to start job in tech! ðŸ’»ðŸ–±
